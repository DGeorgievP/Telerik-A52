/*Task 1
Create a bank account object using revealing module pattern. The object should have the following properties:

- `balance` - number
 
- `deposit` - function that will take one number as a parameter and will add the number to the ballance. Check against invalid numbers and throw an `Error`
 
- `withdraw` - function that will take one number as a parameter and will subtract the number from the ballance. Check against invalid numbers and throw an `Error`. Think about what else can go wrong here and guard against it.
 
- (*Advanced*) `getBalance` - function that will return the current value of the balance. Research and use a [getter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) to do it*/
